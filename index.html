    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>We are aiming to provide insightful visualizations for a Montessori school based on their vast student and
      teacher data along with their operational expenses over the past 5 years. By using this data, we will identify any
      trends that may be affecting the rate at which students join, the type of students they attract, and what sort of
      expenses reap the most rewards and what expenses they can cut on. We also hope to provide them with a better
      understanding of their student demographic which can help with making informed executive
      decisions. <br>

    <h1>Visualization</h1>

    <p>Below are static visualization combining different datasets.
      <br><br>
      The student population graph has different filters one can choose from.
      <br><br>
      The income and expense chart are linked to the profit chart with the selected portion from the income or expense
      chart highlighted on the profit chart.

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    <p>We have added tool tips for all visualizations in order to give
      more detailed information about the data for each stacked bar chart
      and area chart. Some data points or categories may be hard to read,
      and tool tips assist the reader by giving details on demand.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "Student population breakdown by [filter]":
        This visualization shows student demographic information.
        It allows the user to filter the data and visualization based on
        Grade (grade of the students), Location, and Years (number of
        years that each student spent at the school). This allows the
        user more flexibility in the information that they can gather about the
        student population. We chose to use a stack bar chart to show the
        subdivision within the student population.
      </li>
      <li> "Income and Expense per year showing profit": This chart is being used to show
        the profit for the school. The Income and Expense are shown using an area
        chart because we thought that this was the best medium to demonstrate the
        amount of profits and expenses that changed over the 5 years, and the
        resulting profit. This area chart is linked to the "Expenditure per
        year by Category" and the "Income per year by Category" graphs.
        When the user clicks on a particular category from either of the
        two mentioned graphs, the category will appear on this profit graph.
        This allows the user to visualize how each category contributes to
        the school's profit margin.
      </li>
      <li>
        "Expenditure per year by Category": This graph shows the amount of expenditure broken
        down by category for the Montessori School. We chose to use an area chart to show how
        the different categories contributed to the expenditure as a whole. We believe using an
        area chart is the best way to convey the changes and how each category contributes to
        the whole over the 5 years. This is linked to the "Income and Expense per year showing
        profit" and will highlight in that graph the selected category in this graph.

      </li>
      <li>
        "Income per year by Category": This graph shows the amount of income broken down by category
        for the Montessori School. We chose to use an area chart to show how the different categories
        contributed to the income as a whole. We believe using an area chart is the best way to convey
        the changes and how each category contributes to the whole over the 5 years. This is linked to
        the "Income and Expense per year showing profit" and will highlight in that graph the selected
        category in this graph. </li>
      <li>
        "Grade Breakdown by Revenue": This visualization shows the revenue from academic fees,
        broken down by grade over the 5 years. We chose to use a stack bar chart to clearly
        show the subdivision of revenue from academic fees within the different grades.
        This was the clearest way to show the information to the user.
      </li>
    </ul>
